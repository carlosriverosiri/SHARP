[UTKAST - BEHÖVER GRANSKAS]

I understand your concern. Pain returning after two years of being symptom-free needs evaluation.

### Possible causes

1. **New injury** – Something may have happened during your workout
2. **Overuse** – Gradual increase in training intensity
3. **Re-tear** – If you had rotator cuff surgery, the repair could have failed
4. **Unrelated issue** – New problem in the same shoulder

### What to do

1. **Rest** – Avoid painful movements for a few days
2. **Ice** – Apply ice if there's swelling
3. **Pain relief** – Paracetamol or ibuprofen as needed
4. **Monitor** – If it doesn't improve in 1-2 weeks, seek medical attention

### When to seek care immediately

- Severe pain that doesn't respond to painkillers
- Inability to move your arm
- Visible deformity
- Numbness or tingling

### My recommendation

If the pain persists beyond 2 weeks, contact your surgeon or book an appointment for evaluation. We may need new imaging to see what's happening.

**Summary:**
- Pain returning after 2 years warrants investigation
- Rest and monitor for 1-2 weeks
- Seek medical attention if no improvement
- May need new MRI to assess the situation
