# Prompt: Create Postoperative Rehabilitation Program

**Purpose:** Generate evidence-based rehabilitation program for patients after arthroscopic suprascapular nerve decompression.

**Role:** You are an experienced physiotherapist and shoulder specialist with extensive clinical experience in postoperative rehabilitation after arthroscopic (keyhole) decompression of the suprascapular nerve (suprascapular nerve entrapment). 

**Context:** 
- The procedure is minimally invasive, heals quickly
- Patients often have lost strength and function in the supraspinatus and especially the infraspinatus due to prior nerve compression
- Muscle atrophy may be partially irreversible, but function typically improves significantly with rehabilitation

---

## Task

Write a complete, patient-friendly rehabilitation program in **English** that you would hand out to the patient on paper or digitally. 

## Evidence Base

The program must be as evidence-based as possible and built on:

1. Scientific articles, reviews, and case reports from PubMed (e.g., studies on postoperative rehabilitation after suprascapular nerve decompression)
2. Established clinical protocols from recognized shoulder surgeons/orthopedists (e.g., Rothman Orthopaedics, Denver Shoulder Surgeon, or similar)

### Relevant Sources

Examples of relevant sources to base recommendations on or include:

- **Rothman Orthopaedics** Suprascapular Nerve Decompression PT Protocol  
  https://rothmanortho.com/files/post-op-protocols/brandon-j-erickson-md/Suprascapular%20Nerve%20Decompression%20PT%20Protocol.pdf

- **Denver Shoulder Surgeon** Rehabilitation Protocol for Suprascapular Nerve Decompression

- **AAOS** Arthroscopic Suprascapular Nerve Decompression video and case (2025)

- **PubMed examples:**
  - PMID 36515356 (novel techniques including neurolysis)
  - PMID 17187259 (rehabilitation in athletes)

**Briefly cite** the most important sources inline in the program (e.g., "based on the Rothman Orthopaedics clinical protocol") and justify selected elements with reference to evidence.

## Structure Requirements

### 1. Introduction
- Brief explanation of the procedure
- Expected recovery timeline (often pain relief within weeks, gradual improvement in strength and function over 3–6 months)
- General advice (sling use, ice, pain management, when to contact healthcare)

### 2. Phase Division
Recommended **3–4 phases**, for example:
- **Phase 1:** 0–4 weeks
- **Phase 2:** 4–8 weeks  
- **Phase 3:** 8–12 weeks
- **Phase 4:** >12 weeks / return to activity

### 3. For Each Phase Include:
- **Goals** - What to achieve in this phase
- **Allowed activities** - What the patient can do
- **Specific exercises** - With repetitions, sets, frequency, and progression
- **Precautions** - What to avoid
- **Criteria** for progressing to the next phase

### 4. Exercise Focus Areas

Particularly emphasize:
- Early passive/assisted ROM
- Gradual active ROM
- Isometric exercises
- External rotation (infraspinatus)
- Abduction (supraspinatus)
- Shoulder stability
- Scapular control

### 5. Conclusion
- Long-term maintenance
- Signs of complications
- Importance of individualized follow-up

### 6. Reference List

End the program with a separate section titled **"References"** listing all sources you based the recommendations on. 

Format them as clickable markdown links, e.g.:
- [Rothman Orthopaedics Suprascapular Nerve Decompression Protocol](URL)
- [PubMed: Rehabilitation after Suprascapular Nerve Surgery](URL)

## Tone & Style

- **Friendly, motivating, and educational**
- Easy for patients to understand
- Avoid medical jargon or explain it simply
- Include clear descriptions of exercises (no images, but detailed enough for home training)

## Output Format

Markdown format suitable for:
- Printing as PDF
- Sharing digitally
- Publishing on website

Include proper headings, lists, and formatting for easy reading.
